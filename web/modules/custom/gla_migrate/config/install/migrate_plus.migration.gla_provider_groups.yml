# Provider Groups migration
# This migration will create the drupal 'group' and in the 'POST_ROW_SAVE' event
# it will add all the opportunities, providers, and provider profiles as 'related entities'
# in the group so that users in the group can have access to those nodes.
# This is the last migration to be run as it needs to have all the nodes/users from the
# previous migrations to add them to the group.
